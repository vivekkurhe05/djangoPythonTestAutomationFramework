Background information to the Good Financial Grant Practice standard and the global grant community.

The Global Grant Community aims to standardize, simplify and strengthen financial governance of grants. The benefits will be to increase direct funding, reduce administration costs and time for grantors to undertake due diligence and assurance activities and provide an aspirational pathway for organizations to develop their financial governance of grants. It will help to 'level the playing field' and 'democratize' grant funding as good financial grant practice will be accessible to and utilized by all.   This initiative has been developed by the African Academy of Sciences (AAS) under its Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA) platform and a consortium of grantees and grantors.   At its heart, is the Good Financial Grant Practice Standard ("GFGP") - The draft quality standard was submitted to the African Organization for Standardization in May'17 and will be formally adopted by ARSO as a new international standard in June'18. Following adoption by ARSO, this new standard is applicable in all countries - globally.

To accommodate different sizes and complexity of awards the standard has 4 tiers:
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum

The standard is cumulative and so to be compliant to the requirements of, for example, the gold tier you must also be compliant to the requirements of both the bronze and silver tiers and so forth.

Grantees will be able to self-assess against this standard via an on-line portal which will store their self-assessment and supporting documentation. Further information on how the assessment portal works is provided in a short video which can be viewed at www.goodfinancialgrantpractice.org
